# Proximity Alert System
A basic proximity sensor system using an Arduino uno, HC-SR04 distance sensor, and an LED. Implemented in Matlab.

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the various libraries and functionalities that exists within Matlab. Implementing the Arduino support for Matlab opens an entire new field of opportunity when interfacing with the Arduino.
